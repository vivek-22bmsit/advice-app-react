# 🎯 Random Advice Generator

This is my **first web app built with React** – a simple yet fun **Random Advice Generator**!  
It fetches random advice from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and displays it in a clean UI.

Through this project, I learned:
- ✅ How to use **Axios** for API requests
- ⚛️ React **component lifecycle** and **state management**
- 🎨 Basic **UI rendering** and styling in React

## 🚀 Tech Used

- React.js
- Axios
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Advice Slip API
- CSS

## 📦 How to Run

```bash
npm install
npm start
