# advice-app-react
This is my first web app in React, where I learned how to work with APIs, manage state, and build interactive components. The app fetches random advice from the Advice Slip API and displays it in a clean, responsive UI. A fun and beginner-friendly project that helped me understand API integration and React fundamentals.
