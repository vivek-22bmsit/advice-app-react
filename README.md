# Random Advice Generator

This is my **first web app built with React** â€“ a simple yet fun **Random Advice Generator**!  
It fetches random advice from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and displays it in a clean UI.

Through this project, I learned:
- How to use **Axios** for API requests
- React **component lifecycle** and **state management**
- Basic **UI rendering** and styling in React
